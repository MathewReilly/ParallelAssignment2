# ParallelAssignment2
A few notes. I'd recommend running with gcc for both. I had a couple issues with P2 running on g++.
Additionally, for the first part of P2, it can be located in P2Part1.md
### To run with gcc:
```
gcc -lstdc++ -std=c++11 -o cupcake.out Assignment2P1.cpp
./cupcake.out
```

```
  gcc -lstdc++ -std=c++11 -o showroom.out Assignment2P2.cpp
  ./showroom.out
```

### To run with g++:
```
  g++ -std=c++11 -o cupcake.out Assignment2P1.cpp
  ./cupcake.out
```

```
  g++ -std=c++11 -o showroom.out Assignment2P2.cpp
  ./showroom.out
```
